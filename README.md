Hello stranger !

Communicathon is a web app (currently in development).

It can help your kid (or you) to navigate with ease into the web and to communicate better.
There are a some features like:
    - Sending emails with pictograms
    - Talking with pictograms
    - Pictures redirecting to some URL
 
All the project is there ! 

Future features : (Summer 2019)
    - Calendar with pictograms (at first it will be very basic)
    - A Picto-Chat with other Communicathon's users 
    - Better optimisation and all
    
If you want to contribute just ask me, I'll be glad to had some help with this !
